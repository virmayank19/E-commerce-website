      "The Pixel 2 is the smaller sibling of the Pixel 2 XL, which features a 5-inch OLED display and the same aluminium build with a textured coating in the Just Black version. There are stereo speakers in the front, which sound great and the fingerprint sensor is placed at the back. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage. App performance is excellent and the phone doesn’t heat up too often. The display offers good viewing angles and doesn’t suffer from the blue tint issue that plagues the Pixel 2 XL. Camera performance is also really good, although low light landscapes stills and video exhibit some degree of noise. Battery life is decent too, although don’t expect more than a day’s worth of usage with the 2700mAh capacity.",
